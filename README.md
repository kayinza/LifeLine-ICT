# LifeLine-ICT

## Project Summary

LifeLine-ICT is a digital infrastructure management platform that supports the
Uganda University ICT department. The system tracks strategic ICT projects,
inventory assets, IoT deployments, and the maintenance activities that keep
digital services reliable for students and researchers. The repository contains
code for the IoT device layer, the backend APIs, and supporting documentation so
faculties can adapt the platform to their own campuses.

### High-Level Architecture

The solution comprises five collaborating layers:

- **IoT layer** – ESP32-based sensor nodes send telemetry to a lightweight Flask
  logger (`iot/logging`).
- **Backend APIs** – A FastAPI service (`backend/app`) exposes CRUD endpoints for
  projects, resources, locations, maintenance tickets, and sensor sites.
- **GIS & Analytics** – Future modules will combine telemetry and asset data to
  power dashboards and risk assessments.
- **Frontend** – Web dashboards and mobile apps consume the backend APIs.
- **Deployment** – Infrastructure-as-code scripts will package the stack for on
  campus or cloud hosting.

Consult `docs/backend_crud_plan.md` for the architectural rationale that guided
issue `#5` (CRUD API implementation).

### Module Overview

- `iot/` – Firmware sketches and logging scripts for field sensors.
- `backend/` – FastAPI application, domain models, services, and tests.
- `docs/` – Supplemental guides and design notes.
- Additional directories (frontend, gis, deployment) will be filled as the
  broader initiative matures.

## Backend Service (Issue #5 Deliverable)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- `pip` or `uv` for dependency management
- Optional: `uvicorn` CLI for local development

### Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### Running the API

```bash
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

The service listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default. OpenAPI
documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### API Testing Examples

#### Testing with curl

```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Get all projects
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/projects/

# Create a new project
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/projects/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Campus Network Upgrade",
    "description": "Upgrade of campus network infrastructure",
    "status": "planning",
    "budget": 50000.00,
    "start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "end_date": "2024-12-31"
  }'

# Get all resources
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/resources/

# Create a new resource
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/resources/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Main Router",
    "resource_type": "network",
    "status": "active"
  }'

# Get all locations
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/locations/

# Create a new maintenance ticket
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/maintenance-tickets/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Router not responding",
    "description": "Main router not responding to ping requests",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "open"
  }'

# Get all sensor sites
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/sensor-sites/
```

#### Testing with Pagination and Search

```bash
# Get first 10 projects
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/projects/?limit=10&offset=0"

# Search for projects by name
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/projects/?search=campus"

# Get resources with pagination
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/resources/?limit=20&offset=0"
```

#### Using the Interactive Swagger UI

1. Start the server: `uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload`
2. Open your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
3. Click on any endpoint to expand it
4. Click "Try it out" to test the endpoint directly in your browser

### Core Endpoints

| Entity | Base Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Projects | `/api/v1/projects` | CRUD with pagination & search |
| ICT Resources | `/api/v1/resources` | Validates project/location references and enforces ticket rules |
| Locations | `/api/v1/locations` | CRUD with geo metadata |
| Maintenance Tickets | `/api/v1/maintenance-tickets` | Requires resolution metadata when closing a ticket |
| Sensor Sites | `/api/v1/sensor-sites` | Links IoT deployments to resources, projects, and locations |

Each list endpoint accepts `limit`, `offset`, and `search` query parameters and
returns pagination metadata to keep API consumers informed.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest backend/tests
```

The suite provisions an in-memory SQLite database and covers both service-level
rules (such as blocking resource deletion while tickets remain open) and API
contracts.

### Database Migrations

This project uses [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) for database migrations.

To create a new migration, run:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<migration_message>"
```

To apply migrations to the database, run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Data Model Highlights

The backend models capture the following relationships:

- Projects aggregate ICT resources and sensor sites.
- Resources optionally link to projects and locations, and can host sensor
  deployments.
- Maintenance tickets belong to resources and require closure notes when marked
  resolved.

Consult the service-layer docstrings for detailed business rules and
institutional context.

## Contributing

1. Create an issue or pick an existing one (see `issues.md`).
2. Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Follow the layered structure (`api`, `services`, `repositories`, `models`) to
   keep contributions organised.
4. Write tests and run `pytest backend/tests` before opening a pull request.
5. Document behaviour changes in code docstrings or the project docs.
